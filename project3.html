                <p>
                    For this last project, we were to create a website with an interactive element using p5.js, and
                    answering a creative question of our choice. I decided to explore the idea of how unfamiliar things can 
                    still be familiar because the world just recycles and reuses things, and we all have a sense of nostalgia in us.
                    I also wanted to incoporate some
                    storytelling not just through visuals, but also sound so I created some sound art pieces for this project.
                    The project resulted in a sound art library/archive.
