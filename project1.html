                <p>The first project of the semester consisted of three parts: glitch art, sound art, and video art. 
                    All these components were then added into one website, which is stylized based on an early Internet memory of ours.
                    For my website, I stylized it based on the online game Club Penguin with a combination of early 90s/2000s internet aesthetics.
                    Glitch art was created with Audacity (edited in Photoshop + Illustrator), sound art was created with Audacity, and
                    video art was created with physical index cards and edited in Premiere Pro.
