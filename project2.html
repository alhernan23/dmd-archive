                <h2>02: Net Art Zine</h2>
                <p>
                    In the next project of the semester, we were to create a net art zine using a few
                    interactive elements and going with a theme of our choice. I chose the theme of "friendship,"
                    since my relationships with my high school friends are really important to me. In this zine, I got my friends
                    to write their own pieces, and I encoded them so that the user would have to decipher the different "puzzles."
                    I also got to feature my own original art work and music which was fun.
